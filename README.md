## Fizz Buzz - Arduino

<h3>LEDs e Arduino</h3>


<span>This project I have to do the program to arduino to use number 3 to 5 and 4 LEDs of different colors. Light an LEDs for multiples of 3, a different one for multiples of 5, or a third one for multiples of the two numbers, and the fourth LEDs should light up when it is not a multiple of any.</span>
